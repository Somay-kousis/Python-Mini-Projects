The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall.
The way to get started is to quit talking and begin doing.
Life is what happens when you're busy making other plans.
Don't judge each day by the harvest you reap but by the seeds that you plant.
The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.
Tell me and I forget. Teach me and I remember. Involve me and I learn.
The purpose of our lives is to be happy.
In the middle of every difficulty lies opportunity.
Happiness is not something ready made. It comes from your own actions.
Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.
